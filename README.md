# Java-Checkers
Two-player checkers, with a modern GUI and automatically calculated moves!

Coder: Toby Thomas (January 2014)

Play Checkers against a friend on an elegant and modern gameboard!

The game randomly picks which player goes first, for the first game, however, players alternate afterwards.
Moves are predetermined for you, as they highlight which pieces you are able to move. Upon click on a certain
piece, its respective possible moves are shown to you, by highlighting the squares it could land on. When a
player is able to jump one of their opponents pieces, the game automatically detects this and forces you to jump.
Multiple jumps in a row are also possible.

The GUI features a flat and material type gameboard, with buttons to start a new game, learn how to play, and view credits.

Enjoy!
